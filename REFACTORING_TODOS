- Change the getAddons() + conveyAddon() API to Optional<List<Addon>> getAddons() in product -> DONE except for translations
  - Same for getTranslations()
  - => maybe create our own option type with an appropriate semantic like MaybeLoaded<Addons>, MaybeLoaded<Translations> etc.
- Use ResultSetRepresentation in catalog lists
- Check usage of plural in package names (i.e. representations vs. representation)
- Change thumbnails config format to be more in line with addons/models
- AbstractLocalizedEntity -> IsLocalized interface
