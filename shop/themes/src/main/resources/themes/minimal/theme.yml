# theme.yml
# ---------
#
# This is the configuration file for our theme. It defines:
# - Metadata (name and description of the theme)
# - Images sizes for products, collections, etc.
# - Page models (to offer different kind of layout for pages, news articles, products, etc.)
# - Pagination (how many products we want to display per page)
# - Data addons
#
# More information and tools are available online:
# - http://www.mayocat.org/documentation for all info about creating themes for Mayocat Shop
# - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML for more information about the YAML format
# - http://yamllint.com/ to validate your YAML syntax. (Copy-paste your theme.yml in the textarea and click "Go" to
# check whether or not your file is syntaxically valid or not). One frequent mistake when getting started with the YAML
# format is to mix tabs and spaces for indentation. We recommend to only indent using the space character, as it is
# done in this file.
